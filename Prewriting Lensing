Bending Light.  While the idea sounds like something out of a science fiction movie, it is a reality.  Unfortunately, it might
not be as easy as one would hope.  As we dive into the subject it is important to remember that their is
still so much that we don't know about the universe and the laws of physics. But I will, to the best of my ability, try to
explain everything that the scientific community knows about this phenomenon. To start we will go into the history of the
gravitational lensing and its discovery.  Then we will go into the science behind it as well as what efforts that are going on to find
lens.

While Einstein's theory of relativity is given the most credit for coming up with the idea of gravitation lensing, Johann Georg von Soldner
predicted that light can be bent around massive objects before him. When testing out Einstein’s theory by using a solar eclipse to look at
starlight that passed very close to the sun, Aurthur Eddington was able to prove light deflection was possible. Einstein, also was the one to theorize that you could potentially see two images of the same object as light was
bended around another object. Einstein, however never considered the possibility that light could be bent by a whole galaxy and only considered
a single star.  Fritz Zwicky was the first to consider this possibility in 1937 but it was until 1979 that the first gravitational
lens was discovered by a team of scientist at the Kitt Peak National Observatory.  This discovery, initially thought to be two 
identical objects are known as the Twin QSO.

Essentially lensing works much like any of situation involving gravity.  Given that all matter is actually stored energy the
equations of how gravity effects an object with mass can be rewritten to how it effect energy, which is what light is.  So if you where 
to shoot a bullet on earth the gravity would curve the bullet towards the ground until it eventually hit the earth.  However 
if you were really far above the earth, and shot the bullet the gravity would change the trajectory of the bullet but would not hit
the ground.  This is what essentially a gravitational lens does works; however, you can get multiple images from one object because the light
goes out in all direction thus the image can be bent around an object and come back on both sides.  However, the object
effecting the light has to be incredibly massive. The equation to find the angle of deflection is (4GM)/(rc^2) where G is 
the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, r is the radius from the center of gravity, and c is the speed of light.  So you can imagine how massive
an object would have to be in order to cause any type of lensing. 

Until recently, most discoveries of gravitational lens where on accident and where not actively getting hunted down in the cosmos.
Recently, there has been two surveys, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere, to find gravitational lenses.
The one in the northern hemisphere was called the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey or CLASS, this survey found 22 gravitational lenses
by detecting radio signals with Very Large Array.  The other survey was done in Australia at the the Australian Telescope Compact
Array where the scientist there looked for gravitational lenses near quasars. While radio waves were used to find the lens in the last two surveys 
the Hubble Telescope has also found gravitational lenses including the furthest know lens from us.  

In conclusion, gravitation lens was first theorized before Einstein and proven through experiments. But it wasn’t until more
than 50 years after Aurthur Eddington’s experiement that one was actually discovered.  Working much like gravity on object with mass light will bend around massive
objects but it must be incredibly massive such as a black hole or a galaxy.  There is a lot of effort going on right now to 
discover more gravitational lenses by using radio frequencies and looking for arcs and double images.  I believe there is still much
work to be done in the discovery of gravitation lens and can help us better understand our universe.
