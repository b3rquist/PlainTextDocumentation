Gravitational Lensing

Wikipedia
One of the predicitons of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
Johann Georg von Soldner pointed out the Newtonian gravity predicts starlight will bend arround massive object
the first observation of light deflection was performed by noting the stars as they passed the sum
It was done during a solar eclipse to see the star arround the sun
Becasue Spacetime is curved arround massive objects
Can either be from one sourc or a whole galaxy can bend the light arround itself
The first discovery of lensing was in 1979 and became known as Twin QSO discovered by Denis Walsh, Bob Carswell and Ray Weymann
at the Kitt Peak National Observatory

Three types of lensing, strong where there is clear distortion usch as rings, arches, and multiple images.
Weak lensing is when it can be 
Microlensing: no distortion in shaoe can be seen but the ligth recieved from the background object changes in time
Spacetime is curved arround massive balck holes
Einstein said you could observe multiple images from the same source
Angle of curvature is exressed by 4GM/rc^2
Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey went out looking for lensing systems and found 22
Another Survey was done in the southern hemisphere using the Austrailia 20 GHz Telescope
Einstiens Cross is when four images all appear

Solargravitational lensing 
Albert einstein predicted in 1936 that one could use gravitational lens at 542 AU could be used to magnify the image of objects
very far away
